<b>First off, adjust your chair.</b> Adjusting the ergonomics of your office chair keeps you
comfortable throughout the day, and reduces the likelihood of you giving up work because the shape
of your skeleton is all wrong. The following advice is copied and pasted directly from the Canadian
Centre for Occupational Health and Safety. It applies solely to adjustable office chairs. Do not
attempt to adjust non-adjustable chairs without the relevant woodworking knowledge and resources.

1. Stand in front of the chair. Adjust the height so the highest point of the seat, (when in the horizontal position), is just below the knee cap.
2. Sit on the chair and keep your feet flat on the floor.
3. Check that the clearance between the front edge of the seat and the lower part of the legs (your calves) fits a clenched fist (about 5 cm or 2 inches).
4. Adjust the back rest forwards and backwards as well as up and down so that it fits the hollow in your lower back.
5. Sit upright with your arms hanging loosely by your sides. Bend your elbows at about a right angle (90 degrees) and adjust the armrest(s) height until they barely touch the undersides of the elbows.
6. Remove the armrests from the chair if this level can not be achieved or if armrests, in their lowest adjustment, <span class="highlight" data-hint="Otherwise you will have stiffness and pain in your trapezius">elevate your elbows even slightly</span>.
7. Tilt the seat itself forwards or backwards if you prefer.

<b>Float your hands while typing.</b> Don't use a wrist rest, <Sources sources={wristRestSources}>it's bad for you</Sources>. It applies pressure to the underside of your wrist which will compress the tissues, resulting in decreased blood flow.
