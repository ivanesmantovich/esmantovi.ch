The advice is ordered incrementally by the amount of enthusiasm you'll need to implement it.

<b>First off, adjust your chair</b>. Easily the best effort-to-improvement ratio on this list. Make sure your elbows and shoulders are not elevated 8+ hours a day, it's not natural.

<figure>
<blockquote>
1. Stand in front of the chair. Adjust the height so the highest point of the seat, is just below the knee cap.
2. Sit on the chair and keep your feet flat on the floor.
3. Check that the clearance between the front edge of the seat and the lower part of the legs (your calves) fits a clenched fist (about 5 cm or 2 inches).
4. Adjust the back rest forwards and backwards as well as up and down so that it fits the hollow in your lower back.
5. Sit upright with your arms hanging loosely by your sides. Bend your elbows at about a right angle (90°) and adjust the armrests height until they barely touch the undersides of the elbows.
6. Remove the armrests from the chair if this level can not be achieved or if armrests, in their lowest adjustment, <span class="highlight" data-hint="Otherwise, you'll have stiffness and pain in your trapezius">elevate your elbows even slightly</span>.
7. Tilt the seat itself forwards or backwards if you prefer.

<b>Vary it up</b>. Take breaks. Move. Don't keep a static posture for too long. Go for a walk. Weightlifting and pull-ups <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23577204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help a lot</a> by keeping wrist muscles in good shape. <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/hands-free-coding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Try some voice coding</a>.

<b>Relax more often</b>. <Sources sources={stressSources}>This is no joke</Sources>. Suppressed emotional stress can cause pain by tensing muscles or reducing blood flow. Many chronic pain conditions are caused by the brain as a way to distract us from repressed emotions.

<b>Bring your keyboard closer</b>. If the keyboard is too far from you, you'll hyperextend your arms to reach it. Make sure your elbows don’t go beyond a 110° angle

<b>Use a low-profile keyboard</b>. The lower, the better. If your keyboard is higher than your wrists, it forces you to hyperextend them. If your keyboard has tilt stands, <span class="highlight" data-hint="Positive tilt angle significantly increases the pressure within carpal tunnel">don't use them</span>. They exist to improve key visibility for non-touch typists.

<b>Type properly</b>. Press the spacebar with your right hand. Use both hands for shortcuts—right-side modifiers exist for a reason. Learn touch typing, using the correct fingers for the correct keys; <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keybr</a> is the best tool for this. If you have deeply rooted bad typing habits, a great way to break them is to buy a split ortholinear keyboard. It will drop your typing speed to about 15 <span class="highlight" data-hint="Words per minute. 15 is very slow, the average is 50">WPM</span>, but in return you'll get as close to a clean slate as you can. A year ago I was at 150 WPM, but I was typing with only five or six fingers, and they pressed God knows which keys. I bought the ZSA Voyager, and it forced me to learn from scratch. It was very painful, but the result is worth it—it's a night-and-day difference.

<b>Float your hands while typing</b>. Don't use a wrist rest—<Sources sources={wristRestSources}>it's bad for you</Sources>. Wrist rests apply pressure to the underside of your wrist, compressing tissue and reducing blood flow. Don't confuse wrist rests with the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/ac360pp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">palm pads</a> that you can find on some ergonomic keyboards; palm pads provide support without impacting circulation. It's much easier to float-type on a low-profile keyboard. Rest your hands when you're not typing.

<b>Put the keyboard on your lap</b>. Some people call this <Sources sources={russianStyleSources}>«Russian style»</Sources>. This is actually my favorite advice on this list—I program like this 95% of the time. Negative tilt improves blood flow, you don't depend on having an ergonomic desk, it makes arm extension impossible, and your elbows are forced into a good ergonomic position. It's also the most comfortable way to float-type. Compact keyboards work best this way—if your keyboard has a numpad, it's probably too wide. I used an HHKB this way for years and it was amazing. My current setup is the ZSA Voyager on a cutting board with a soft towel on top. Peak ergonomics.

<b>Avoid working in the cold</b>. Don't work under an air conditioner. Cold reduces blood flow.

<b>Cut back on salt and sugar</b>. This one's uncommon. My dentist gave me this advice (programmers aren't the only ones suffering from RSI). High glucose levels directly stimulate inflammatory markers in tendon cells, contributing to RSI. Salt can cause swelling. When tissues swell due to fluid retention, they can compress the median nerve as it passes through the narrow carpal tunnel in your wrist, leading to RSI.

<b>Try using layers and home-row mods</b>. Buy a keyboard from ZSA, they're great and support layers at the firmware level through <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QMK</a>. Or try it with any keyboard using software like <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanata</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KMonad</a>. Remember that <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/faqs/index.html#home-row-mods-are-hard-to-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home-row mods aren't for everyone</a>. More layers ≠ more ergonomics—<a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/thumb-ergo/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can actually overuse your thumbs</a>. I use a ZSA Voyager <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/6JN7l/latest/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with only one layer</a>, and it's perfect.

<b>Try an alternative layout</b>. Dvorak, Colemak, Workman, Sturdy, <Sources sources={alternativeLayoutSources}>there are a lot of them</Sources>. Switch only as a last resort if you've tried the other options and still have problems.

<b>Cut back on coffee</b>. Caffeine constricts blood vessels and elevates stress, both of which can contribute to RSI.
