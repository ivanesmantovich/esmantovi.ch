Advices are ordered incrementally by the amount of enthusiasm you will need to implement them.

<b>First off, adjust your chair</b>. Adjusting the ergonomics of your office chair keeps you
comfortable throughout the day, and reduces the likelihood of you giving up work because the shape
of your skeleton is all wrong. The following advice is copied and pasted directly from the Canadian
Centre for Occupational Health and Safety. It applies solely to adjustable office chairs. Do not
attempt to adjust non-adjustable chairs without the relevant woodworking knowledge and resources.

<blockquote>
1. Stand in front of the chair. Adjust the height so the highest point of the seat, (when in the horizontal position), is just below the knee cap.
2. Sit on the chair and keep your feet flat on the floor.
3. Check that the clearance between the front edge of the seat and the lower part of the legs (your calves) fits a clenched fist (about 5 cm or 2 inches).
4. Adjust the back rest forwards and backwards as well as up and down so that it fits the hollow in your lower back.
5. Sit upright with your arms hanging loosely by your sides. Bend your elbows at about a right angle (90 degrees) and adjust the armrest(s) height until they barely touch the undersides of the elbows.
6. Remove the armrests from the chair if this level can not be achieved or if armrests, in their lowest adjustment, <span class="highlight" data-hint="Otherwise you will have stiffness and pain in your trapezius">elevate your elbows even slightly</span>.
7. Tilt the seat itself forwards or backwards if you prefer.

<b>Vary it up</b>. Take breaks, move, don't keep a static posture for too long. Go for a walk. Weightlifting and pullups <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23577204">help a lot</a> by maintaining wrist muscles in a good shape. <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/hands-free-coding">Try some voice coding</a>.

<b>Relax more often</b>. <Sources sources={stressSources}>This is no joke</Sources>. Suppressed emotional stress can cause the pain by tensing muscles or reducing blood flow. Many chronic pain conditions are caused by the brain, in order to distract us from repressed emotions.

<b>Use a flat profile keyboard</b>. The flatter the better.

<b>Type properly</b>. Press spacebar with right hand. Use both hands to press shortcuts, right side modifiers are there for a reason, chording is very bad for your hands.

<b>Float your hands while typing</b>. Don't use a wrist rest, <Sources sources={wristRestSources}>it's bad for you</Sources>. It applies pressure to the underside of your wrist which will compress the tissues, resulting in decreased blood flow. Blood flow is a common theme (rephrase) as you might have noticed.

<b>Put the keyboard on your lap</b>. Some people call it <Sources sources={russianStyleSources}>"Russian style"</Sources>. This is actually my favorite advice on this list, i program like this 95% of the time. Tilting the keyboard slightly downward increases the blood flow, you don't depend on having an ergonomic desk, you can't overreach even if you try and your elbows are forced in the perfect ergonomic position. It is also the most comfortable way to float type.

<b>Avoid working in the cold</b>. Don't work under the air conditioner. Cold reduces blood flow.

<b>Cut back on salt and sugar</b>. This is an uncommon one. My dentist gave me this advice (programmers are not the only ones suffering from RSI). High glucose levels directly stimulate inflammatory markers in tendon cells → RSI. Salt causes swelling, when tissues swell due to fluid retention, they can compress the median nerve as it passes through the narrow carpal tunnel in the wrist → RSI.

<b>Try using layers and home row mods</b>. Buy a keyboard from ZSA, they are great and support layers on firmware level through <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm">QMK</a>. Or you can try it with any keyboard with the help of software like <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata">Kanata</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">KMonad</a>. Remember that <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/faqs/index.html#home-row-mods-are-hard-to-use">home row mods are not for everyone</a>. And more layers ≠ more ergonomics, <a href="https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/thumb-ergo/index.html">you can actually overuse your thumbs</a>. I myself use ZSA Voyager <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/6JN7l/latest/0">with only one layer</a> and it's perfect for me.

<b>Try an alternative layout</b>. Dvorak, Colemak, Workman, Sturdy... <Sources sources={alternativeLayoutSources}>There are a lot of them</Sources>

<b>Cut back on coffee</b>. Caffeine shrinks blood vessels and elevates stress, both of which can cause RSI.
