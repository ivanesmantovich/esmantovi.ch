No matter WHAT you do, how you remain healthy is using your body daily. Fitness, I find, is a discipline that especially hurts from an optimization mindset. The more I optimize, the less I enjoy it. The less I enjoy working out and doing sports, the less healthy I feel. On the contrary, if I don’t optimize it, I do enjoy working out, eating healthy, etc. This creates habits I see myself following for decades.
Hacks are products of the mind. Fitness, nutrition, health are the body’s domain. Don’t overuse your brain, listen to your body too! You may discover the (un)reasonable effectiveness of raw power.
